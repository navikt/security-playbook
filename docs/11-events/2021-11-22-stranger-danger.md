### Live-hacking med Simon Maple fra Snyk

Modern cloud native technologies enable you to build, deploy, and scale rapidly. But this increased complexity exposes your application to new risks and vulnerabilities. Each layer of your cloud native application – spanning your code, third party dependencies, containers, and clusters – exposes you to new security concerns. And we’ll show you just how easy they are to exploit!

During this live hacking session, led by Simon Maple, Snyk’s VP of Developer Relations & Community, we’ll exploit an application as an attacker would to show threats, vulnerabilities, and misconfigurations that are most common in cloud native apps. Then, we’ll show you how you can protect your application through clear remediation actions and best practices for each attack scenario.
